Kedar Madi is working towards his PhD in biomedical engineering at the Virginia Tech-Wake Forest School of Biomedical Engineering & Sciences (SBES) and set to graduate in Fall 2024. He previously completed his undergraduate career in bioengineering (with a minor in neuroscience) at the University of Pittsburgh. Kedar's research centers around morphometry (i.e., shape analysis) of neuroanatomical structures—especially the hippocampus—to understand how they are affected by conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease and traumatic brain injury. His work has been featured at multiple conferences, such as the American Society of Functional Neuroradiology (ASFNR) 2022 Annual Meeting and the Alzheimer's Disease International Conference (AAIC) in 2023. When he’s not busy with research, Kedar loves PC gaming, weightlifting, creating techy gadgets and art, and snuggling with his cat, Gary.
