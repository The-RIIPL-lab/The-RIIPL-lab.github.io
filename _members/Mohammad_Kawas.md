As a postdoctoral fellow with expertise in functional connectivity and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal analysis, Dr. Mohammad Kawas is a key part of the RIIPL lab. His work has been supported by the NIH StrokeNet Fellowship, providing him with the opportunity to engage in cutting-edge research on stroke and its impact on brain structure and function. His ongoing research projects include the analysis of fMRI data in a study assessing the efficacy of a vestibular thermal excitation device in reducing symptoms in Parkinsonâ€™s patients and its correlation with network connectivity. He is also collaborating on several projects, including the continuation of his StrokeNet work with the neurosurgery department, as well as a collaboration to study functional network connectivity in a cohort of cynomolgus monkeys exposed to alcohol under varying hierarchical stresses
